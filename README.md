# Pintos
Pint-OS is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. It supports kernel
threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in
a very simple way. In the Pint-OS projects, you and your project team will strengthen its support
in all three of these areas.

Pint-OS could, theoretically, run on a regular IBM-compatible PC. Unfortunately, it is impractical
to supply every student a dedicated PC for use with Pint-OS. Therefore, we will run Pint-OS
projects in a system simulator, that is, a program that simulates an 80x86 CPU and its peripheral
devices accurately enough that unmodified operating systems and software can run under it. In
class we will use the QEMU simulator.
